title: 'Priority Stacks: A Time Management System'
---

There is always a limit to time, and we cannot buy easily more of it. Thus we try to efficiently manage our time. By efficiently making use of our time we can try to reduce stress and ensure we do what we want to do. Time management systems on both the small and large scale such as the Pomodoro technique and agile sprints are well known examples.

I developed my personal system that works for me. In all honesty, it is likely pieced together from the advices I've gotten from many different people. Simply put, it is a task dividing method. Divide your tasks based on priority and then rank them based on time. By ordering on time needed, you can pick and choose your tasks to whatever your schedule is. A simple division would be as follows.

1) Recurrent; tasks that occur periodically such as preparation for weekly meetings.
2) Deadline; tasks that need to be finished by a specific date and time. The work your manager gives you and preferably wanted done yesterday.
3) Important; tasks that need to be done but without any further pressure. Updating documentation is a great example of this.
4) Inconsequential; tasks that could be helpful, but are of little note. Little things as checking a mail-list for information or reading a scientific paper are examples as long as they are not your main job.

It is of course possible to make fewer or more stacks though I recommend at least 3 stacks and a maximum of 7. Try to keep it manageable and organized. For the same reasons, try to have a maximum on the number of tasks within each stack. This can also aid in preventing overworking, and in the worst-case burnout. Play around to see what works well for you.

There are other options to try out as well. Place your tasks into your calender. This is easy for the recurrent tasks, but also try to schedule time specific for different kinds of tasks. Don't forget, variety is the spice of life. Another option would be to combine the stacks with a kanban-style board, moving the tasks from left to right to even track the ongoing status of them. 

In short, my personal stacks system can be a good basis and has enough room to make it your own. Try it out, see if it works for you. Throw away the things that do not work and keep what does. Just use a system to help yourself, because it will only be better if people can manage their time and tasks in a way that works great for them.
