# Starting a Blog
**Hello World!**

Corny rehashed jokes aside, welcome to this small little corner of the internet.
If you read this I will likely already have made several posts on the blog and you simply stumbled upon this first one.
This first post is to set some expectations and accountability for myself.

## My Goals for the Blog
I want to create this blog to share my findings regarding... well basically anything I find interesting. As a result posts will mostly be about software development, programming, and bioinformatics. However, I could also easily write about personal values, psychology, physics, art, or gaming.
 
The plan is to write and post every other week. The length will of course differ by the topic, but I will try to be clear and concise. In a way this blog is also an exercise for me to improve my writing skills, while allowing me to focus on the topics that interest me. Hopefully this blog can one day become a repository of my learnings, my interests, and my career.
